### 💡 Best Practices

- Keep your base configuration in `vite.base.ts` focused on project-wide concerns
like build output structure, server settings, and shared plugins.

- Source folder configurations should only contain
folder-specific settings like port numbers, base URLs, and generators.

- Use formatters consistently across all source folders
to maintain code style uniformity in generated files.

- Explicitly specify environment variables in DefinePlugin
rather than relying on prefix-based exposure.
This makes your dependencies clear and prevents security issues.

- Add generators incrementally.
Start with just base generators, then add more as you need them.
This keeps the initial setup simple while allowing growth.
