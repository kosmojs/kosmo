Generated fetch clients need to work with framework-specific data structures,
particularly reactive stores that wrap plain data.

To handle this, `KosmoJS` provides an `unwrap` placeholder
that framework generators override with their own implementations.

The default `unwrap` implementation is a no-op that simply returns data unchanged.

When you add a framework generator like the SolidJS generator,
it overwrites this placeholder with framework-specific logic.

This architecture allows fetch clients to call `unwrap` internally
without knowing which framework you're using.

For SolidJS, the generator provides an implementation that handles SolidJS stores:

```ts [lib/src/front/unwrap.ts]
export type MaybeWrapped<T> = import("solid-js/store").Store<T> | T;
export { unwrap } from "solid-js/store";
```

The `MaybeWrapped` type indicates that data might be a store or a plain value.
The `unwrap` function extracts the plain value regardless.

This allows you to pass reactive data to fetch clients safely:

```tsx [pages/users/index.tsx]
import { createStore } from "solid-js/store";
import useFetch from "_/front/fetch/users";

export default function Page() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = createStore({
    name: "",
    email: "",
  });

  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    // unwrap is called internally by the fetch client
    await useFetch.POST([], formData);
  };

  return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>...</form>;
}
```

Different generators might implement these utilities differently
based on their framework's patterns, but they all serve the same purpose
of adapting framework-specific data structures to the fetch client's requirements.
