### 💡 Best Practices

- Place the `outfile` in a location that's easy to serve or commit to version control.
Many teams put it at the project root or in a `docs/` directory.

- Keep your `info.description` updated with authentication requirements,
rate limiting policies, and other important API usage information.

- Define multiple servers for different environments (dev, staging, production)
so users can easily switch between them in documentation tools.

- Use semantic versioning for your API version.
Update it when making breaking changes to help API consumers understand compatibility.

- Review the generated spec periodically to ensure it accurately represents your API.
While the generator captures most details automatically,
you might want to add manual descriptions or examples for clarity.
